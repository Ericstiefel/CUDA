Stream Compaction is a strategy generally for later reuse, where you only keep data that meet some condition (greater than a num, is even, etc).

How it works:

Kernel 1) Get a prefix sum per block of each element (exclusive).
Output the sum of each block in a new memory location.
Kernel 2) Take the sum resuls of each block and do a prefix sum over them
Kernel 3) Place each output element (meeting the condition) to index local_idx + block_prefix[block_idx - 1].
